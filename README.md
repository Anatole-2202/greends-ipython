## Install Python 3 and Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

[Python in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial):
  * Python 3 interpreter; For Windows, download either from python.org or from the Microsoft Store; For macOS install Python using Homebrew; Linux: built-in Python 3 installation
  * VS Code; Download from VS code site
  * VS Code Python extension: A Visual Studio Code extension with rich support for the Python language (for all actively supported versions of the language: >=3.7), including features such as IntelliSense (Pylance), linting, debugging, code navigation, code formatting, refactoring, variable explorer, test explorer, and more!

## Python documentation and tutorials

You can find information on basic concepts and features of the Python language and system at  [The Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). In particular, you might be interested in the following specific topics discussed in class:
* [f-strings and other formatting options](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html)

A nice interactive site is W3schools' [Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) where you can find in particular an easy to use  [Python reference documentation](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_reference.asp)

## Class 1 (September 15, 2023)

1. [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/), Section on "Functions, Variables"
   * **Do before next class.** [Shorts: Visual Code for CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/shorts/visual_studio_code_for_cs50/)
    
2. Some useful keyworks for the command line interface in terminal:
* `echo > filename` to create a new file (same as `code filename` in CS50 videos); to create an empty file, just press return when asked for the argument.
* `ls` to list files in folder
* `cp filename newfilename` to copy a file, e.g. `cp ..\hello.py  farewell.py` (`..` represents parent folder)
* `mv filename newfilename` to rename or move file, e.g. `my farewell.py goodbye.py` or `mv farewell.py ..` (move one folder up)
* `rm filename` to delete (remove) file
* `mkdir foldername` to create new folder
* `cd foldername` change directory, e.g. `cd ..` 
* `rmdir foldername` to delete folder
* `clear` to clear terminal window
