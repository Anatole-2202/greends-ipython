1. Questionnaire Q0 (test) on the topics of the previous class;
2. Work on [Problem set 0](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/): "indoor voice", "playback speed", and "making faces". For this last one, check [the emoji chart](https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html) and follow the instructions: Every emoji has a unique Unicode assigned to it. When using Unicode with Python, replace "+" with "000" from the Unicode. And then prefix the Unicode with "\\". For example, "U+1F605" will be used as "\U0001F605". But there are alternative ways to encode emojis in your Python code: check [this link](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-include-emojis-in-your-python-code/)

<summary> Class 12 (December 22, 2023): Args and kwargs, list comprehension, dictionary comprehension, lambda, map, filter </summary>
 
1. Discussion of assigments P5 (*numb3rs* and *um*)
2. Discussion of guidelines for final project
3. Presentation of some topics from [Lecture 9](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/notes/9/):  args (*) and kwargs (**), list comprehensions, lambda functions, map, filter, dictionary comprehensions. Check examples scripts in the [ETC folder](https://github.com/isa-ulisboa/greends-ipython/tree/main/ETC).

   Example: distinct possible ways of creating a list with all the cubes of even numbers up to *N*. In the last cases, `map` applies a given function to each element of a list. Likewise, `filter` applies a boolean function to filter elements of a list. Both function can be executed in parallel over the elements of the list since each output is independent of the outputs for the remainder elements of the list.
   * With list comprehension:
     ```
     def cube(x):
         return x*x*x
     L=[cube(x) for x in range(N) if x%2==0]
     ```
   * With `filter` to select even numbers and `map`to compute cubes:
     ```
     def even(x):
         return x%2==0
     numbers=list(range(N))
     even_numbers=list(filter(even, numbers))
     cubes=list(map(cube,even_numbers))
     ```
   * Also with `filter` and `map` but defining implicitly the *cube* and *even* functions with `lambda` instead of `def`: 
     ```
     numbers=list(range(N))
     even_numbers=list(filter(lambda x: x%2==0, numbers))
     cubes=list(map(lambda x: x*x*x,even_numbers))
     ```
   * The most compact way of solving the problem involves `lambda` and list comprehension. In the example below, if one would just write `lambda x: x*x*x` instead pf `(lambda x: x*x*x)(x)` the output list would be a list of lambda functions. 
     ```
     L=[(lambda x: x*x*x)(x) for x in range(N) if x%2==0]
     ``` 
5. Observations about using vectorization to speed-up computations.

   A conditional can be replaced by arithmetic and logical operations. For example, let `L=[x/5 for x in range(-10,10)]` be a list of equally spaced numbers between -2 and 2, and say we want to apply the stepwise linear sigmoid function to the elements of the list. One could define *sigma* as below and then apply it to `L` with `map`.
   ```
   def sigma(x):
       if x>1:
           return 1
       elif x<-1:
           return -1
       else:
           return x
   list(map(sigma,L))
   ```
   However, instead of using the conditional `if` once can define *sigma* in a simpler way with logical and arithmetic operations. 
   ```
   def sigma(x):
       return (x>=1)*1+(-1<x<1)*x+(x<=-1)*-1
   list(map(sigma,L))
   ```
   Note that we don't need to define explicitly *sigma*: it could be encapsulated in a `lambda` function `lambda x: (x>=1)*1+(-1<x<1)*x+(x<=-1)*-1` as the first argument of `map`. One advantage of using arithmetic and logical operations is that computations can then be easily vectorized, which allows to speed them up, since the processing time for a pair of vectors is similar to the processing time for a pair of numbers.

   Similarly to *list comprehension*, Python provides *dictionary comprehension* which allows to create dictionaries. The example below uses `ord`which is a function that returns the *ascii* index of a character, to create a dictionary of vowels, where the key is the vowel in uppercase and the value is the rank of the letter starting at 0 for *a*.
   ```
   {x.upper(): ord(x.lower())-97 for x in 'aeiou'} # returns {'A': 0, 'E': 4, 'I': 8, 'O': 14, 'U': 20}
   ```

## Install Python 3 and Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

<details markdown="block">
  
<summary> Steps to install Python 3 and Visual Studio Code</summary>

[Python in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial):
  * Python 3 interpreter; For Windows, download either from python.org or from the Microsoft Store; For macOS install Python using Homebrew; Linux: built-in Python 3 installation
  * VS Code; Download from VS code site
  * VS Code Python extension: A Visual Studio Code extension with rich support for the Python language (for all actively supported versions of the language: >=3.7), including features such as IntelliSense (Pylance), linting, debugging, code navigation, code formatting, refactoring, variable explorer, test explorer, and more!

## Python documentation and tutorials

### CS50P
The main tutorial for the class is [CS50P](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/). The table below compares the contents of that course with another well-known 
free online Python Programming course at [PP.fi](https://programming-23.mooc.fi/). The **CS50P** course problem sets tend to be difficult, while you can find at **PP.fi** a set of problems with a larger range of difficulty, from very easy to advanced. Both online courses provide a platform for coding and testing the corretness of the solutions. Both courses provide recorded lectures: [CS50P](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/) and [PP.fi](https://programming-23.mooc.fi/#lectures).
