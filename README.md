# Class 1 (September 13, 2024): data types, variables, functions

</summary>
 
1. Install Python and VS code: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial. Alternatively, you can code in the CS50 cloud environment (VScode). Two steps: 1. log in into your github account; 2. access your code space at https://cs50.dev/. This environment allows you to test automatically your scripts for the CS50 problem sets.
2. Some useful keyworks for the command line interface (CLI) in terminal: 
 * `code filename.py` to create a new file 
 * `ls` to list files in folder
 * `cp filename newfilename` to copy a file, e.g. `cp ..\hello.py  farewell.py` (`..` represents parent folder)
 * `mv filename newfilename` to rename or move file, e.g. `my farewell.py goodbye.py` or `mv farewell.py ..` (move one folder up)
 * `rm filename` to delete (remove) file
 * `mkdir foldername` to create new folder
 * `cd foldername` change directory, e.g. `cd ..` 
 * `rmdir foldername` to delete folder
 * `clear` to clear terminal window
3. The REPL (interactive Read -Eval-Print-Loop) environment: see https://realpython.com/interacting-with-python/
4. All values in Python have a **type**. The five basic types are: integer, float, string, Boolean, and None.
   * strings (`str`), variables, print (a function), parameters (e.g. `end=`), input, comments, formatted strings (`f"..."`), `.strip()`, `.title` (methods)
   * integers (`int`), operations for integers, casting (e.g. `str`to `int`)
   * floating point values (`float`), round, format floats (e.g. `f"{z:.2f}`)
   * `True`, `False`, `and`, `or`, `not`
5. Functions, `def`, `return`
6. Suggested problems: [CS50 Problem set 0](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/)

# Class 2 (September 20, 2024): conditionals, lists, dictionaries

</summary>

1. Conditionals:
  - `if`, `elif`, `else`:
    ```
     if score >= 70:
         print("Grade: C to A")
     elif score >= 60:
         print("Grade: D")
     else:
         print("Grade: F")
     ```
  - `match`:
    ```
    match species:
        case 'versicolor':
            label=0
        case 'virginica'
            label=1
        case _:
            label=2
    ```
4. Pythonic coding: `def main()`, define other functions, call `main()`. The code must be modular.
5. While loops, for loops, `break`, `break` and `return`
6. Data type *list* `[]`: methods `append`, `extend`
7. Data type *dictionary* `{}`, `items()`, keys `.key()` and values `.values()`
   ```
   knights = {'gallahad': 'the pure', 'robin': 'the brave'}
   for k, v in knights.items():
       print(k, v)
   if 'gallahad' in knights:
       print('Go Gallahad')
   ```
9. Suggested problems: [CS50 Problem set 1 and 2](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/).

# Class 4 (October 4, 2024): handling exceptions

</summary>

Handling exceptions in Python: raising and catching exceptions. 

1. Example from (https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/shorts/handling_exceptions/). Exercise: adapt the proposed code to be more modular, where the main function is something like the one below:

```
def main():
    spacecraft = input("Enter a spacecraft: ")
    au=get_au(spacecraft)
    m = convert(au)
    print(f"{m} m")
```

2. Exercises from [CS50 Problem set 3](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/3/).

For the *fuel gauge* problem (https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/3/fuel/), try to organize your code as follows. As suggested in *hints*, you should catch `ValueError` and  `ZeroDivisionError` exceptions in your code. In the code below, the user is being asked for correct values for `x,y` until they satisfy the requirements: `x,y` must be inputted as a string `x/y`, `x` has to be less or equal to `y`, and `y` cannot be zero. The function `get_string_of_integers_X_less_than_Y` in the code below should take care of that.

```
def main():
    # asks user for input until the input is as expected
    x,y=get_string_of_integers_X_less_than_Y()
    # compute percentage from two integers
    p=compute_percentage(x,y)
    # print output 
    print_gauge(p)
```

3. A few examples of code that can be helpful to solve problems in problem set 3:

Example of basic use of `try-except` to catch a `ValueError`:
```
try:
    x = int(input("What's x?"))
except ValueError:
    print("x is not an integer")
else:
    print(f"x is {x}")
```

Function for requesting an integer from the user until no exceptions are caught:
```
def get_int():
    while True:
        try:
            x = int(input("What's x?"))
        except ValueError:
            print("x is not an integer")
        else:
            break
    return x
```

We may want to exit the execution of our script if some exception is caught. This can be done with `sys.exit()`, which can also be used to print a message.
```
import sys # import module
try:
    x = int(input("What's x?"))
except ValueError:
    sys.exit("x is not an integer")
```

Example of code that catches `CRTL-C` or `CRTL-D`:

```
while True:
    try:
        x=int(input())
    except ValueError:
        print('x is not integer')
    except KeyboardInterrupt: #CTRL-C
        print('\n KeyboardInterrupt')
        break
    except EOFError: # CTRL-D
        print('\n EOFError')
        break
    else:
        print(x)
```

# Class 5 (October 11, 2024): libraries, modules, APIs

</summary>

1. (modules) You can store your own functions in modules (which are just python scripts) and `import` then into your main code. Let's imagine you created a file named `mymodule.py` in a given folder. In your main script, you can import the file if the folder belongs to list of folders the Python interpreter will look for. You can check that by running the following lines of codes in the Python interpreter:
```
>>>import sys
>>>sys.path
```
If the folder where `mymodule.py` was created does not belong to that list, you can add it with `sys.path.append` which allows you to import your module. To that end, you can include the followings lines to your main script:
```
import sys
sys.path.append(r'path-to-folder') # folder where mymodule is
import mymodule
```
where `path-to-folder` is the path that you can easily copy in your IDE. 

If your module includes a function named, say,  `get_integer`, you can then use the function in your main script either by calling `mymodule.get_integer()` or you can instead load the function with `from mymodule import get_integer` and then just call it with `get_integer()` in the main script as in the following script.
```
import sys
sys.path.append(r'/workspaces/8834091/modules') # where file mymodule.py is
from mymodule import get_integer
def main():
    x=get_integer()
    print(x)
main()
```
Contents of `mymodule.py`: 
```
import sys
def get_integer() -> int:
    while True:
        try:
            return(int(input('type a number:  ')))
        except ValueError:
            print('not an integer number: try again')
        except KeyboardInterrupt: #CTRL-C
            print('\n If you want to exit type CTRL-D')
        except EOFError: # CTRL-D
            sys.exit('\n exit as requested')
```

Often, you import a module that is available at (https://pypi.org/project/pip/). Say you want to load the module `random` which provides a series of functions for sampling, shuffling, and extracting random numbers from a variety of probability distributions. If the module is not already available, you can typically load it in your terminal with 
```
$pip install random
```
and then import it on your main script with `import random`. If you want to know which is the folder where the module is located, you can get that information with `random.__file__`.

2. (`sys.argv`) Previously, we used module `sys`, in particular functions  `sys.exit()` and  `sys.path`. Another useful function is `sys.argv`,  that allows you to have access to what the user typed in at the command line `$` as in 
```
import sys
print(len(sys.argv)) # returns the number of words in the command line after $python
print(sys.argv[1]) # returns the 2nd word, i.e., the first word after $python myscript.py
```

For instance, the following script named `sum.py` prints the sum of two numbers that were specified in the command line with `$python sum.py 1.2 4.3`:
```
import sys
try:
    x,y = float(sys.argv[1]), float(sys.argv[2])
    print('the sum is',x+y)
except IndexError:
    print('missing argument')
except ValueError:
    print('The arguments are not numbers')
```
3. (APIs) *application program interfaces* allow you to communicate with a remote server. For instance,  `requests` is a package that allows your program to behave as a web browser would.  Consider the following script `myrequest.py` that allows you to explore the *itunes* database (https://performance-partners.apple.com/search-api):
```
import requests
import sys
try:
    response = requests.get("https://itunes.apple.com/search?entity=song&limit=1&term=" + sys.argv[1])
    print(response.json())
except IndexError:
    sys.exit('Missing argument')
except requests.RequestException:
   sys.exit('Request failed')
```
You can easily adapt that code to access a different database. For instance if you want to explore the GBIF database (https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/gbif-api-beginners-guide/), you can just replace the main line of code in `myrequest.py` with
```
response=requests.get('https://api.gbif.org/v1/species/match?name='+ sys.argv[1])
```
and execute it with, say,  `$python myrequest.py Tracheophyta` in the terminal.

There are many ways of running an API in Python. The following example shows how you can access satellite imagery through the *Google Earth Engine* API and compute the mean land surface temperature at some location from the MODIS11 product. To be able to use the API, you need to have a Google account, and an earth engine project associated to it.
```
# pip install earthengine-api
import ee
# Trigger the authentication flow.
ee.Authenticate()
# Initialize the library.
ee.Initialize(project='project-name') # e.g. 'ee-my-mlc-math-isa-utl'
# Import the MODIS land surface temperature collection.
lst = ee.ImageCollection('MODIS/006/MOD11A1')
# Selection of appropriate bands and dates for LST.
lst = lst.select('LST_Day_1km', 'QC_Day').filterDate('2020-01-01', '2024-01-01')
# Define the urban location of interest as a point near Lyon, France.
u_lon = 4.8148
u_lat = 45.7758
u_poi = ee.Geometry.Point(u_lon, u_lat)
scale = 1000  # scale in meters
# Calculate and print the mean value of the LST collection at the point.
lst_urban_point = lst.mean().sample(u_poi, scale).first().get('LST_Day_1km').getInfo()
print('Average daytime LST at urban point:', round(lst_urban_point*0.02 -273.15, 2), 'Â°C')
```

4. Solve problems from CS50P [Problem_set_4](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/4/). In particular, for problem *Bitcoin price index* organize your code so the main function is the following:

```
def main():
    x=read_command_line_input()
    price=get_bitcoin_price()
    print(f"${x*price:,.4f}")
```

# Class 6 (October 18, 2024): virtual environments; file I/O

</summary>

1. Virtual environments in Python: a virtual environment (https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is:
   - Used to contain a specific Python interpreter and software libraries and binaries which are needed to support a project (library or application). These are by default isolated from software in other virtual environments and Python interpreters and libraries installed in the operating system.
    - Contained in a directory, conventionally named `.venv` or `venv` in the project directory, or under a container directory for lots of virtual environments.
    - Not checked into source control systems such as Git.
    - Considered as disposable â€“ it should be simple to delete and recreate it from scratch. You donâ€™t place any project code in the environment.
    - Not considered as movable or copyable â€“ you just recreate the same environment in the target location.

The following commands work in the  [CS50 codespace](https://cs50.dev/) that runs Linux (check with `$cat /etc/os-release` in the terminal). Some need to be slightly adapted for Windows.

Firstly, let's check what are the available packages and their versions in the base environment, and also let's get extra information about the package `requests` (e.g. dependencies):

```
$ pip list 
$ pip show requests
```

Next, let's create a virtual environment. One can first create (with `mkdir`) a folder called, say, `my_venvs` so all the virtual environments are created in that folder. Then, the virtual environment `myvenv` can be created with:
```
my_venvs/ $ python3 -m venv myvenv # creates environment called myvenv with Python 3
```
In case one needs to delete the virtual environment, one just needs to delete the folder. This can be done with `$ sudo rm -rf myvenv` in the terminal (Linux). After the virtual environment has been created, one needs to activate it. In Linux, this is done by executing `activate` which lies in the `bin` folder of the virtual environment:

```
my_venvs/ $ source myvenv/bin/activate # note that activate needs to be sourced
```
As a result, the prompt shows `(myvenv) my_venvs/ $` which indicates that `myvenv` is now activated. One can check the Python version witj `$python -V`. To de-activate a virtual environment, the command is `$ deactivate`. With the environment activated, let's try to install a few packages, specifying the versions. For instance, install the following packages.

```
(myvenv) my_venvs/ $ pip install random11==0.0.1
(myvenv) my_venvs/ $ pip install geopy==1.23.0
(myvenv) my_venvs/ $ pip install requests==2.25.0
```
Some of this packages depend on additional packages that are installed automatically. To list all instaled packages within the environment `myvenv` one can execute  `(myvenv) $ pip list` as before. Compare the version of `requests` in `myvenv` with the version returned initially in the base environment: this one is 2.25.0 while the one in the base environment is more recent. One can also check where `requests` is installed in `myvenv` with the command  `(myvenv) $ pip show requests`. 

Check the system path (where Python will look for installed packages)  by executing `print(sys.path)`: one can do this from the terminal with the command
```
(myvenv) my_venvs/ $ python -c 'import sys; print(sys.path)'
```
Notice that the folder in `myvenv` where the virtual environment packages are installed is listed, but the folders where base packages are stored is not. Since a virtual environment is not movable, one needs to collect the information about the installed packages in a file in case one intends to share the environment (e.g. in GitHub). Towards that end, one needs to create a file typically called `requirements.txt` with the packages names and versions, that can be used to create a clone of the environment on another machine. This is done, still within `myvenv` (i.e. with `myvenv` activated) with the following command:
```
(myvenv) my_venvs/ $ pip freeze > requirements.txt  
```
Note that the file `requirements.txt` is created in the folder that contains `myvenv` and not within `myvenv` itself: this makes sense, since one does not want to store scripts or data within `myvenv` but just packages and the Python version.  Since `requirements.txt` is now available, one can create a copy of `myvenv` called, say, `myvenv2`. Firstly, one needs to de-activate `myvenv`. Then, the commands to be executed in the terminal are:
```
my_venvs/ $ python3 - m venv myvenv2 # create new virtual environment with the Python 3 interpreter called myvenv2
my_venvs/ $ source myvenv2/bin/activate # activate myvenv2
(myvenv2) my_venvs/ $ pip install -r requirements.txt # install packages and versions listed in requirements.txt
```

Exercise: go back to `myvenv`, add package (say, `emoji==0.1.0`), re-build `requirements.txt`, and create new environment `myvenv3` and install the  set of packages listed in the new `requirements.txt`.

2. File I/O

As discussed in (https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/notes/6/) `open` is a functionality built into Python that allows you to open a file and utilize it in your program. The open function allows you to open a file such that you can read from it or write to it. The most basic way to use `open` allow us to enable file I/O with respect to a given file. In the example below, `w` is the argument value that indicates that the file is open in writing mode. The instruction `file.write(...)` will entirely rewrite the file, deleting the previous contents.
```
name='Bob'
file = open("names.txt", "w")
file.write(name)
file.close()
```
As an alternative, if the goal is to add new contents to the file, which is appended to the existent content, then `w` should be replaced by `a` (append). Each call to `file.write(name)` will then add the value of `name` to the end of `file`. 

Instead of explicitly opening and closing a file, it's simpler to use the so-called *context manager* in Python, using the keyword `with`, which automatically closes the file:
```
with open("names.txt", "w") as f:
  f.write(name)
```
If one wishes to read from a file, then the file has to be opened in reading mode as in the following example. The method `readlines` reads all lines of the file, and stores them in a list, where each element of the list is the contents of the corresponding line.
```
with open("names.txt", "r") as f:
  L=f.readlines(name)
```
However, it is possible to read one line at the time:
```
with open('myfile.txt','r') as f:
    N=0
    for line in f:
        N+=1
print('number of lines', N)
```
Aa an alternative, this can be done with method `readline`. This can be included in a loop to read the whole file. Notice that when the end of the file is reached, `readline` returns the empty string, and this can be easily tested with a condition.

Reading a file in Python gives the flexibility of visiting any position in the file. The initial position is 0 by default but can be instantiated with `f.seek(n)`. Then,  `f.read(10)` for instance reads *n* characters from that initial position. Method `f.tell()` returns the current position in the file. 

A file can be of type *text* (human-readable) or *binary*. Binary files like images for instance are read with `with open('myfile.txt','rb') as f`. 

Exercise: Consider the file downloaded from INE (the Portuguese Institute of Statistics) about causes of fires by geographical location [rural_fires.csv](rural_fires.csv). The source is INE: "Rural fires (No.) by Geographic localization (NUTS - 2013) and Cause of fire; Annual" for 2023. Write a script to read the file and exclude the lines which are not formated as a table (header lines). The formatted lines should be written into a new file, say (`table_rural_fires.csv`). 
```
with open('rural_fires.csv','rb') as f:
    with open('table_rural_fires.csv',"w") as fw:
         for line in f:
              if line[0] in ['1','2','3']: # or smth like line.startswith('1'):
                 fw.write(line)
```
Since the file contains non ASCII characters, one might want to try to decode those characters correctly. Note that Python provides methods `encode` and `decode` as in the example below.
```
str_original = 'Ã§Ã£o'
bytes_encoded = str_original.encode(encoding='utf-8')
print(type(bytes_encoded))
str_decoded = bytes_encoded.decode()
print(type(str_decoded))
print('Encoded bytes =', bytes_encoded)
print('Decoded String =', str_decoded)
print('str_original equals str_decoded =', str_original == str_decoded)
```

# Class 7 (October 25, 2024): tabular data; pandas

</summary>

### Create a Pandas DataFrame from scratch

Pandas dataframes have an intrinsic tabular structure represented by rows and columns where each row and column has a unique *label* (name) and *position* number  inside the dataframe. The row labels, called dataframe index, can be integer numbers or string values, the column labels, called column names, are usually strings. Use the following script to create a dataframe with random values. Notice the terminology for rows (`index`) and columns (`columns`). 
```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(6, 4), index=list('abcdef'), columns=list('ABCD'))
print(df)
```
Exercices: 

1. print the column names of `df` with `.columns`.
2. Create a `Series` that corresponds to column `A` with `['A']`
3. Create a new dataframe that corresponds to columns `A` and `C` with `[['A','C']]`. 

Notice that `.columns` returns a `pd.Index` object. This is to provide extra functionality and performance compared to lists. To extract a list of names, one can use  `.columns.tolist()` or `.columns.values`. 

### Reading a csv file, selecting columns by name, selecting rows by condition

Consider the dataset that described 517 fires from the Montesinho natural park in Portugal. For each incident weekday, month, coordinates, and the burnt area are recorded, as well as several meteorological data such as rain, temperature, humidity, and wind (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikasukani/forest-firearea-datasets). For reference, a copy of the file is available [forestfires.csv](forestfires.csv). The variables are:

- X - x-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 1 to 9
- Y - y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 2 to 9
- month - month of the year: "Jan" to "dec"
- day - day of the week: "mon" to "sun"
- FFMC - FFMC index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20
- DMC - DMC index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3
- DC - DC index from the FWI system: 7.9 to 860.6
- ISI - ISI index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10
- temp - the temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30
- RH - relative humidity in %: 15.0 to 100
- wind - wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40
- rain - outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4
- area - the burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84

The goal is to download the file and use package `Pandas` to explore it and solve the following tasks.

1. Read the file with `pd.read_csv` and show the first 10 rows with `.head()`.
2. Create list of column names and determine column data types with attribute `.dtypes`.
3. Print a summary of the dataframe with `.info()`.
4. Create a `Series` with the temperature values for all 517 fires.
5. Create a `DataFrame` just with columns `month` and `day`.
6. Select fires for which the temperature is higher than 25 Celsius, and between 20 and 25 Celsius; note that each condition needs to be surrounded  by `(...)` and can be connected with `&` or `|` or negated with `~`.
7. Select fires that occured on weekends; use the conditional function `.isin()`
8. Check if there are no `Null` values in the dataframe with `.notna()`. You can sum along columns with `.sum()`.

### Select rows and columns with loc (label-based indexing) and iloc (positional indexing)

These are operators to select rows and columns from a dataframe. `loc` selects rows and columns using the row and column *names*. `iloc` uses the *positions* in the table. Notice that new values can be assigned to selections defined with `loc`and `iloc`.

1. Interpret the result of `fires.iloc[0:3,2:4]`
2. Use `loc` and `is.in()` to select fires from August and September and just FWI based variables values for those fires.
3. Use `iloc` to select the first 20 fires and just the FWI based variables values

### Combining positional and label-based indexing

There are several possibilities to combine positional and label-based indexing:

1. (with `iloc`) Using `df.columns.get_loc()` which converts the name of one column into its position. Then `iloc` can be used to perform the selection. For multiple columns determined by a list of column names, one can use instead `df.columns.get_indexer()`. Example: Use `iloc` to select the first 20 fires and just the FWI based variables values, using the names rather than the positions of those variables.
2. (with `loc`) Using `df.index[]` to extract the index names. Then, `loc` can be used to perform the selection. Example: `fires.loc[fires.index[0:20], ['FFMC', 'DMC', 'DC', 'ISI']]`.

### Exporting to file

Exporting is done with operations named `.to_...` as listed in (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/io.html)

1. Export your file as an Excel spreadsheet with  `.to_excel("filename.xlsx", sheetname="fires", index=False)`
2. Read an Excel spreadsheet with: `pd.read_excel("filename.xlsx", sheetname="fires", index=False)`

### Use generative AI to help with the following tasks
1. Create a dataframe from a dictionary
2. Reduce the fires dataframe with `group_by` to get just one row per month, and average temperature, average RH, and number of fires per month. See (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/groupby.html)
3. Merge with new dataframe to get a new variable that contains the full name of the month. See (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/merging.html)

<summary> Class 12 (December 22, 2023): Args and kwargs, list comprehension, dictionary comprehension, lambda, map, filter </summary>
 
1. Discussion of assigments P5 (*numb3rs* and *um*)
2. Discussion of guidelines for final project
3. Presentation of some topics from [Lecture 9](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/notes/9/):  args (*) and kwargs (**), list comprehensions, lambda functions, map, filter, dictionary comprehensions. Check examples scripts in the [ETC folder](https://github.com/isa-ulisboa/greends-ipython/tree/main/ETC).

   Example: distinct possible ways of creating a list with all the cubes of even numbers up to *N*. In the last cases, `map` applies a given function to each element of a list. Likewise, `filter` applies a boolean function to filter elements of a list. Both function can be executed in parallel over the elements of the list since each output is independent of the outputs for the remainder elements of the list.
   * With list comprehension:
     ```
     def cube(x):
         return x*x*x
     L=[cube(x) for x in range(N) if x%2==0]
     ```
   * With `filter` to select even numbers and `map`to compute cubes:
     ```
     def even(x):
         return x%2==0
     numbers=list(range(N))
     even_numbers=list(filter(even, numbers))
     cubes=list(map(cube,even_numbers))
     ```
   * Also with `filter` and `map` but defining implicitly the *cube* and *even* functions with `lambda` instead of `def`: 
     ```
     numbers=list(range(N))
     even_numbers=list(filter(lambda x: x%2==0, numbers))
     cubes=list(map(lambda x: x*x*x,even_numbers))
     ```
   * The most compact way of solving the problem involves `lambda` and list comprehension. In the example below, if one would just write `lambda x: x*x*x` instead pf `(lambda x: x*x*x)(x)` the output list would be a list of lambda functions. 
     ```
     L=[(lambda x: x*x*x)(x) for x in range(N) if x%2==0]
     ``` 
5. Observations about using vectorization to speed-up computations.

   A conditional can be replaced by arithmetic and logical operations. For example, let `L=[x/5 for x in range(-10,10)]` be a list of equally spaced numbers between -2 and 2, and say we want to apply the stepwise linear sigmoid function to the elements of the list. One could define *sigma* as below and then apply it to `L` with `map`.
   ```
   def sigma(x):
       if x>1:
           return 1
       elif x<-1:
           return -1
       else:
           return x
   list(map(sigma,L))
   ```
   However, instead of using the conditional `if` once can define *sigma* in a simpler way with logical and arithmetic operations. 
   ```
   def sigma(x):
       return (x>=1)*1+(-1<x<1)*x+(x<=-1)*-1
   list(map(sigma,L))
   ```
   Note that we don't need to define explicitly *sigma*: it could be encapsulated in a `lambda` function `lambda x: (x>=1)*1+(-1<x<1)*x+(x<=-1)*-1` as the first argument of `map`. One advantage of using arithmetic and logical operations is that computations can then be easily vectorized, which allows to speed them up, since the processing time for a pair of vectors is similar to the processing time for a pair of numbers.

   Similarly to *list comprehension*, Python provides *dictionary comprehension* which allows to create dictionaries. The example below uses `ord`which is a function that returns the *ascii* index of a character, to create a dictionary of vowels, where the key is the vowel in uppercase and the value is the rank of the letter starting at 0 for *a*.
   ```
   {x.upper(): ord(x.lower())-97 for x in 'aeiou'} # returns {'A': 0, 'E': 4, 'I': 8, 'O': 14, 'U': 20}
   ```

## Python documentation and tutorials

### CS50P
The main tutorial for the class is [CS50P](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/). The table below compares the contents of that course with another well-known 
free online Python Programming course at [PP.fi](https://programming-23.mooc.fi/). The **CS50P** course problem sets tend to be difficult, while you can find at **PP.fi** a set of problems with a larger range of difficulty, from very easy to advanced. Both online courses provide a platform for coding and testing the corretness of the solutions. Both courses provide recorded lectures: [CS50P](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/weeks/) and [PP.fi](https://programming-23.mooc.fi/#lectures).
