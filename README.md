* `ls` to list files in folder
* `cp filename newfilename` to copy a file, e.g. `cp ..\hello.py  \farewell.py` (`..` represents parent folder)
* `mv filename newfilename` to rename or move file, e.g. `my farewell.py goodbye.py` or `mv farewell.py ..` (move one folder up)
* `rm filename` to delete (remove) file
* `mkdir foldername` to create new folder
* `cd foldername` change directory, e.g. `cd ..` 
* `rmdir foldername` to delete folder
