## Install Python 3 and VS Code

[Python in VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial):
  * Python 3 interpreter; For Windows, download either from python.org or from the Microsoft Store; For macOS install Python using Homebrew; Linux: built-in Python 3 installation
  * VS Code; Download from VS code site
  * VS Code Python extension: A Visual Studio Code extension with rich support for the Python language (for all actively supported versions of the language: >=3.7), including features such as IntelliSense (Pylance), linting, debugging, code navigation, code formatting, refactoring, variable explorer, test explorer, and more!

## Class 1 (September 15, 2023)

1. [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/), Section on "Functions, Variables"
   * [Shorts: Visual Code for CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/shorts/visual_studio_code_for_cs50/)
    
2. Some useful keyworks for the command line interface in terminal:
* `echo > filename` to create a new file (same as `code filename` in CS50 videos)
* `ls` to list files in folder
* `cp filename newfilename` to copy a file, e.g. `cp ..\hello.py  \farewell.py` (`..` represents parent folder)
* `mv filename newfilename` to rename or move file, e.g. `my farewell.py goodbye.py` or `mv farewell.py ..` (move one folder up)
* `rm filename` to delete (remove) file
* `mkdir foldername` to create new folder
* `cd foldername` change directory, e.g. `cd ..` 
* `rmdir foldername` to delete folder
* `clear` to clear terminal window

3. [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/), Section on "Functions, Variables"
   * Video on [CS50 Video Player](https://video.cs50.io/JP7ITIXGpHk) or [YouTube](https://youtu.be/JP7ITIXGpHk):
     - functions, parameters, arguments
     - return value, input function
     - variables and assignments
     - comments
     - strings (str data type)
     - `\n` (newline)
     - format string, e.g. `f"hello {name}")`
     - first examples of methods (built-in function)  on strings, e.g. `name.strip()` (47')
     - chain methods (52'30)
     - other methods on strings: `title, split`
     - integers (int data type) (59'40)
     - operations: `+, -, *, /, %`
     - interactive mode for Python `>>>`  [1:00]
